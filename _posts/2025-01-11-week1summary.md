## Reflection
The first week of the season opened up with a disappointing loss for the Falcons. While facing the Steelers, they did have a strong bend but don't break defense, as they allowed 6 field goals. The offense was only able to muster 2 scoring drives, with 1 field goal in the first quarter and a touchdown at the end of the second quarter. In his debut, Cousins was unable to put on a strong performance. He also looked uncomfortable in the pocket, as there were moments where he made the incorrect read and stared down his receivers. The offense also struggled to get the ball moving in the second half, with less than 30 net yards in both the 3rd and 4th quarters. There was a high frequency of run plays, but it did not feel like there were enough play action passes to keep the defense honest.

While the defense did not allow any touchdowns, they still allow 6 field goals. The defense felt unequipped to stop the run of the Steelers offense. The Steelers were able to run the ball 17 times in the 4th quarter, which allowed them to control the clock. The Steelers also did a good job of attacking different parts of the field with their runs, as they almost equally attacked the left and the right side throughout the game. It was mentioned that Arthur Smith wanted the Steelers to stay away from Jessie Bates, and Fields did not have any passes towards the middle of the field, and only 3 deep shots during the whole game.

## What I Would Have Changed
The biggest sticking point of this game was a lack of play action passing. While I do agree, I would have also liked the Falcons to have attacked TJ Watt's side more with the run. I think some split back backfields would have been beneficial to keep the defense honest, given the Falcons have 2 quality backs. 

On defense, I would have wanted to utilize heavier personnel, as the Falcons linebackers fit the mold of being quick and athletic, as compared to the thumper prototype of a linebacker. Even if it meant remaining in nickel, it would have been interesting to see Jessie Bates play as a sub linebacker. This would have also allowed him to get more involved in short passes.

On special teams, I would have liked to see some more aggressive field goal blocks. Boswell had 6 attempts at a field goal, and it did not feel like the Falcons were able to get any pressure on the attempts.

## Plays of the Game

**Play #68**

This was the only touchdown of the entire game. The 2 minute offense was pretty effective for the Falcons on this drive, and it ended successfully. Cousins did a good job on this play, and Pitts was wide open to put 6 more on the board for the Falcons.

**Play #73**

This was a huge play by the Steelers to get 3 points before the half. Fields was able to execute it very well, and the Falcons defense made a big mistake in not covering Pickens well.

**Play 128**

This was a great play by the defense at a very crucial point in the game. If the Steelers had gotten this first down and scored a touchdown on the drive, the game would have been pretty much out of reach for the Falcons. The linebackers played this well by getting to Fields and stopping from being able to push forward.

## Players of the Game

**Jessie Bates**

While the defense did not have the greatest of days, Bates made his presence felt throughout the game. He was everywhere and had a good sense of where the ball was going to go on almost every play. 

**Bijan Robinson**

Robinson was the player led the team in both carries and receptions, and he was pivotal to the offense. The Falcons handed the ball off a lot this game, and this game would have been a lot worse without Robinson's performance.

**Chris Boswell**

While I would have liked to highlight 3 Falcons, Boswell was too important to ignore. His 6 field goals propelled the Steelers to victory and there was never really a doubt about any of the 6 field goals he attempted.
