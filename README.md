# Hooked on Falcons

A simple blog analyzing the play of the Atlanta Falcons over the 2024-25 NFL Season. Film analysis, roster analysis, and statistics analysis.

## About

In this blog, I will detail the process of breaking down what I see in NFL All 22 film. I hope to widen my understanding of NFL football and the phases of the game. Additionally, I perform data visualization and build dashboards through Tableau to search for and highlight important statistics. Other things I do behind the scenes are data collection, as I collect photos and information about each play of the game, and data cleaning, as I must modify data collected by other sources(mainly NFLFastR) to meet my needs.
